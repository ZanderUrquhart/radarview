            <li>Fixed many crashes, program stability improved.</li>
            <li>Changed "warnings" and "watches" to "storm-scale warnings" and "large-scale warnings" to more accurately reflect what the program actually displays.</li>
            <li>Improved colors for winter weather related large-scale warnings.</li>
            <li>Added Ice Storm Warning, Wind Chill Advisory, Wind Chill Watch, and Wind Chill Warning.</li>

            <li>Added SPC Storm Report display, press R while in the program to use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Precipitation Types</h2>
        <p>Internally, the program diagnoses 12 different precipitation types using <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-20-0118.1'>a revised version of the Bourgouin technique (Birk et al. 2021)</a>, with additional freezing rain and snow subtypes added by me. Other algorithms will be added at a later time, such as <a href="http://employees.oneonta.edu/blechmjb/JBpages/M361/BUFKITlabs/Bourgouin/Bourgouin2000.pdf">the original Bourgouin technique developed in 2000</a>. Since viewing all 12 types can be confusing, RadarView is set by default to simplify this into a three- or four-type view. The simplifications are as follows:</p>

        <p>In the 3-type view, freezing rain, ice pellets, and any mixing of two or more precipitation types is considered to be a wintry mix.</p>
        <p>In the 4-type view, the displayed precipitation type in the case of mixes is generally the most impactful type of precipitation contained in the mix. For example, in a freezing rain-ice pellet mix, the ice pellets will accumulate on the ground and the freezing rain will glue the pellets together into a glaze ice coating. Additionally, only the freezing rain will accumulate on power lines. Since the freezing rain is probably producing a higher impact than the ice pellets in this situation, RadarView's 4-type display shows this as freezing rain.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>The default color tables have been designed intentionally to be usable for both fully color-sighted users and most colorblind users. I've used the <a href="https://pilestone.com/pages/color-blindness-simulator-1#">Pilestone Color Blindness Simulator</a> to guide development of the color tables, and they should work for users with Deutanopia (the most common form of red-green colorblindness), Protanopia (a less common form of red-green colorblindness), and Tritanopia (blue-yellow colorblindness). I have not yet been able to make them usable for users with Monochromacy (black-and-white vision), but I hope to do that at some point in the future.</p>
        <p>Though I've my best on the others, I have not checked the default color table for the 12-ptype precipitation depiction</p>
        <p>The velocity color table is currently not very good for those with Deutanopia or Protanopia. I will hopefully be soon fixing or working around this</p>

        <h2>Products and How to Use Them</h2>

        <h3>Base Reflectivity</h3>
        <p>More complete description coming later. For now:</p>
        <p>Reflectivity is a measure of how much of a radar signal is reflected back to the radar site. Higher reflectivity values usually signify heavier precipitation, and low values (≤20 dBZ for rain, ≤5 for snow) usually signify no precipitation. Radar displays often use cool colors to show light/no precipitation and warm colors to show heavy precipitation. Colors used in RadarView by default are as follows:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Color</th>
                <th>Meaning (rain)</th>
                <th>Meaning (snow)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Black/Gray</td>
                <td>No rain</td>
                <td>No snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dark Blue</td>
                <td>No rain</td>
                <td>Very light snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Blue-Green</td>
                <td>Very light rain</td>
                <td>Light snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Green</td>
                <td>Light rain</td>
                <td>Moderate snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yellow</td>
                <td>Moderate rain</td>
                <td>Heavy snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Red</td>
                <td>Heavy rain</td>
                <td>Extremely heavy snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Magenta</td>
                <td>Extremely heavy rain, possibly hail</td>
                <td>-</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Base Velocity</h3>
        <p>More complete description coming later. For now:</p>
        <p>Doppler Velocity is a measure of how much the storm is moving toward or away from the radar site. Greens and Blues indicate motion toward the radar; Reds and Oranges indicate motion away.</p>

        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Differential Reflectivity scans are all sorts of messed up</li>
            <li>Map "wobbles" a bit when panning</li>
            <li>Large-scale warnings in some areas don't render in the program.</li>
            <li>Large-scale warnings make the program significantly slower to render</li>
            <li>Velocity scans sometimes have large sections of null data, which disrupts the storm-relative velocity computation</li>
            <li>Dealiasing algorithm does not entirely work right</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Future Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click RAP soundings</li>
            <li>City markers for improved map readability. For example, a dot over Dallas, Texas reading "DALLAS".</li>
            <li>Historical data display</li>
            <li>mPING report display</li>
            <li>Multiple-panel display modes</li>
            <li>Custom color tables, possibly a GUI tool to assist non-programmers in making their own color tables</li>
            <li>Better accessibility features, specifics to be figured out later</li>
            <li>Possibly TDWRs</li>
            <li>Possibly Canadian and UK radars</li>
            <li>Possibly a beginner-friendly mode for non-meteorologists to use</li>
        </ul>
