        <h1>About the Creator</h1>
        <p class="version"><i>RadarView Beta Version 5 - Released September 13, 2023</i></p>
        <p>Amelia Urquhart (born 2004) is a weather photographer and a meteorology student at the University of Oklahoma. She has been interested in meteorology as long as she can remember, and she has early memories of watching The Weather Channel's secondary cable station on which they played the radar loop and forecast for the Dallas-Fort Worth area on repeat. She has sheltered several times from severe storms and tornadoes, including the Rowlett, TX EF-4 of 2015; the Wylie, TX Hailstorm of 2016; and the North Dallas EF-3 of 2019. She has experienced a heat index of 115 °F and a wind chill of −22 °F.</p>
        <p>She started to learn to program in Java in 2016, and began her journey in meteorological programming by making a program that displayed current GFS model data. This later evolved into a project which uploaded images of current model data from the HRRR, HRDPS, HRRR-AK, HRDPS-NORTH, and GFS for areas across the world. RadarView is her current primary project, and she later plans to make an open-source model data viewer that functions in a similar way.</p>
        <p>Her scientific interests include tornadogenesis (an extremely common interest among meteorologists), RFD formation, giant hail formation, winter weather precipitation type nowcasting, and mesoscale weather modeling. She is still an underclassman in the undergraduate meteorology program, and her interests are likely to evolve and expand.</p>
